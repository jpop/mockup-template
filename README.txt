Overall Use

This template is for general html template creation from photoshop design files or from scratch. It uses as it's base the latest core files from html5boilerplate (http://www.html5boilerplate.com). The purpose of using this to begin all html templates for our projects is to develop a consistent strategy with a solid starting point. It is more than likely and good that this will continue to be improved as we work with it. The source can be found on Github(https://github.com/gravitate/Mockup-Template) and comments for changes, improvements or additions are welcomed.
